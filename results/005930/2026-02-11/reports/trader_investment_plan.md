The provided analysis for **Samsung Electronics (005930)** presents a compelling case for caution, rooted in both technical extremes and fundamental realities. 

### Market Analysis & Decision Rationale

**1. Technical Overextension:**
The most alarming metric is the **90% extension from the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)**. In the history of large-cap equities, specifically cyclical semiconductor giants, such a deviation from the long-term mean is rarely sustainable. It indicates a "blow-off top" phase where retail enthusiasm has decoupled from institutional accumulation. The **bearish MACD divergence** confirms this; while prices have remained high or moved sideways, the underlying momentum is fading, suggesting that "smart money" is distributing shares to "weak hands."

**2. The Fundamental "NVIDIA Fallacy":**
While Samsung is a beneficiary of the AI tailwind, its business model remains capital-intensive with lower margins compared to fabless AI leaders. Unlike NVIDIA, Samsung must carry the massive overhead of fabrication plants and is currently facing stiff competition. **SK Hynix** maintains a lead in HBM3E yields, and **TSMC** remains the undisputed leader in advanced logic foundry. Samsung’s current valuation at 165,800 KRW appears to be pricing in a "best-case scenario" for its 2nm transition and HBM shipments that has yet to be reflected in the bottom line.

**3. Risk/Reward Symmetry:**
With the 10-day EMA at 161,164 KRW acting as the only immediate floor, a breach there opens a massive vacuum down to the **50-day SMA at 131,000 KRW**. Chasing an additional 5-10% upside while exposing the portfolio to a potential 20-25% mean reversion is mathematically unsound. 

### Strategic Implementation
Following the provided plan, the priority is **capital preservation**. The transition of HBM from a specialized product to a commodity-like cycle will eventually lead to price normalization. By selling now, we lock in gains and prepare to re-enter when the technical indicators (RSI and MACD) reset and the price finds support near the 50-day SMA.

### Conclusion
The divergence between price and momentum, coupled with extreme historical extension, signals that the top is likely in or very near. To ignore the "tsunami warning" of a 90% mean-extension is to invite unnecessary drawdown.
