## Detailed Technical Analysis

### 1. Trend Analysis: Multi-Timeframe Strength
The trend structure has shifted from bearish to bullish over the last three weeks:
*   **Long-Term Trend**: The **200-day SMA ($238.78)** remains significantly below the current price and is sloping upward. This indicates the primary long-term uptrend remains intact despite the recent volatility.
*   **Medium-Term Trend**: The **50-day SMA ($268.34)** was recently reclaimed. The price had spent most of January below this level, but the breakout above $268 provides a strong signal that the correction has concluded.
*   **Short-Term Momentum**: The **10-day EMA ($269.91)** is providing immediate dynamic support. The price is currently trading just above this line, suggesting that short-term buyers are aggressive.

### 2. Momentum Indicators: Positive Convergence
*   **MACD**: The MACD has successfully crossed into positive territory, reaching **2.95**. The rapid ascent from a low of -6.23 in late January confirms a powerful shift in momentum. This "v-shaped" recovery in MACD often precedes sustained uptrends.
*   **RSI**: The RSI is currently at **61.60**. This is a "sweet spot" for traders: it is high enough to show strength but below the 70 threshold, meaning the stock is **not yet overbought**. In late January, the RSI hit an extreme low of **17.91**, which correctly signaled a capitulation bottom.

### 3. Volatility and Volume Confirmation
*   **Bollinger Bands**: AAPL is trading in the upper half of its Bollinger range. The **Upper Band is at $282.27**, suggesting there is still room for approximately 3% upside before hitting immediate volatility resistance. The wide range between the upper and lower bands ($240.46) reflects the high volatility seen in January.
*   **VWMA**: The **Volume-Weighted Moving Average ($264.35)** is trending below the current price. Since the price is higher than the average price paid by investors (weighted by volume) over the recent period, it confirms that the recent price gains are backed by significant buying conviction.

### 4. Recent Price Action Insights
Between February 4 and February 6, AAPL reached a local peak of **$277.86**. The subsequent minor dip to $273.68 appears to be a healthy consolidation. Volume on the way up (Jan 30 - Feb 4) was significantly higher than the volume during the minor pullback of the last two days, indicating that the selling pressure is weak.

## Conclusion & Outlook
AAPL has successfully navigated a deep correction and is now in a **confirmed uptrend**. The reclamation of the 50-day SMA and the positive MACD crossover are high-conviction signals for further upside. While a minor consolidation near the current $273 level is possible, the path of least resistance appears to be toward the Bollinger Upper Band ($282) and potentially toward previous highs.
