The analysis provided presents a compelling bull case for Apple (AAPL) that balances fundamental recovery with strategic risk mitigation. 

### Market Analysis & Rationale:

1.  **Fundamental Strength (The "China Proxy"):** The 37% revenue jump from TSMC is a critical lead indicator. As the sole provider of Apple's silicon, TSMC's performance directly correlates with Apple's production cycles. This data effectively counters the narrative of a terminal decline in China, suggesting that Apple’s brand remains a dominant force despite geopolitical headwinds.
2.  **Strategic "Kitchen Sinking":** The transition of the Apple Card to JPMorgan and the settlement of UK regulatory hurdles are classic "clearing the decks" moves. By resolving these lingering issues, management is reducing the "uncertainty discount" applied to the stock's valuation. Historically, Apple’s stock performs best when it moves from a period of regulatory headlines to one of operational execution.
3.  **The AI "Super-Cycle":** Apple’s approach to AI is fundamentally different from its peers. While others are heavily burdened by CapEx for data centers, Apple’s "Lean AI" strategy forces the cost of AI onto the consumer through a hardware upgrade cycle (requiring the latest A-series or M-series chips). This protects margins and ensures that AI is a revenue driver rather than just a cost center.
4.  **Technical Outlook:** An RSI of 61 indicates that the stock has strong bullish momentum without being overextended into the "sell" zone (typically >70-75). Maintaining a position above key moving averages suggests that the path of least resistance is currently higher.

### Risk Mitigation:
The proposed plan to enter 60% now and 40% on a retest of the $268 level is a disciplined approach to entry, mitigating the risk of buying at a local peak. The stop-loss at $258 provides a clear exit strategy if the "double top" thesis materializes, limiting downside risk to approximately 5.7%.

### Final Recommendation:
Given the convergence of strong hardware demand (TSMC data), a clear path for AI-driven revenue, and a cleaner regulatory profile, the risk-reward ratio favors the upside. The technical momentum is supportive of a move toward the $282 target.
